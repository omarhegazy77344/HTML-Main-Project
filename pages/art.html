        In engaging prose and with practical examples and anecdotes, an eye-opening look at human reasoning and essential reading for anyone with important decisions to make.

        Have you ever:
        • Invested time in something that, with hindsight, just wasn't worth it?
        • Overpayed in an Ebay auction?
        • Continued doing something you knew was bad for you?
        • Sold stocks too late, or too early?
        • Taken credit for success, but blamed failure on external circumstances?
        • Backed the wrong horse?
        
        These are examples of cognitive biases, simple errors we all make in our day-to-day thinking. But by knowing what they are and how to spot them, we can avoid them and make better choices-whether dealing with a personal problem or a business negotiation; trying to save money or make money; working out what we do or don't want in life: and how best to get it.
        
        Simple, clear and always surprising, this indispensable book will change the way you think and transform your decision-making-work, at home, every day. It reveals, in 99 short chapters, the most common errors of judgment, and how to avoid them.
